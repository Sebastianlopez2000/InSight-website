            <h2>Introducing the InSight App</h2>
            <p>Our app allows users to copy and paste their website URL into a box. The app then extracts all the relevant information from the website using a customised API, and integrates AI to find where you stand in your market to find your closest competitors.</p>
            <p>This extracted information is then used to create a bespoke marketing audit which will tell you everything you need to know about your company and where it stands in its marketing efforts. Importantly, the marketing audit allows the app to understand where its marketing strategy could be improved. This marketing audit can be viewed and downloaded as a PDF file onto your iPhone and MacBook.</p>
            <p>The app then suggests the top 3 recommended marketing campaigns that would best align to the needs of your company. You can learn about each campaign strategy, requirements, ROI, and associated costs (on average).</p>
            <p>If you see a campaign idea that stands out, you can select the 'Visualise' button which will automatically bring up a 3D interactive environment on your device to show a visualisation of the suggested campaign. For example, if the campaign is a billboard, the VR would show a billboard ad for your specific campaign in Piccadilly Circus. The environment can also be used with VR headsets.</p>
            <p>If you like the concept but want to improve the design or any other aspect of the campaign, or you want to make the VR a reality, you can get in touch and we will schedule an introductory meeting to discuss your needs.</p>
