            <h2>Introducing the InSight App</h2>
            <p>Our app helps you understand your market position and identify your closest competitors. Just paste your website URL into the app, and it will extract relevant information using a customized API and AI technology.</p>
            <p>The app then creates a personalized marketing audit for your company, highlighting your strengths and areas for improvement. This audit can be downloaded as a PDF on your iPhone or MacBook.</p>
            <p>Based on the audit, the app suggests the top 3 marketing campaigns that best suit your needs. Learn about each campaign's strategy, requirements, expected ROI, and average costs.</p>
            <p>If a campaign interests you, click the 'Visualize' button to see a 3D interactive preview on your device. For example, visualize a billboard ad for your campaign in Piccadilly Circus. You can also use a VR headset for an immersive experience.</p>
            <p>If you want to refine the campaign design or make the VR preview a reality, contact us to schedule a meeting.</p>
